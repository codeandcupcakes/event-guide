# Code and Cupcakes Virtual Event Guide

Code and Cupcakes was originally designed and delivered as an in-person workshop, but, during the times of pandemic, we understand we might all need to explore other formats. To that end, we've put together some notes on how you can manage an event virtually.

## Planning & Organization

The bulk of your planning and organization can happen largely the same as it would for an in-person workshop. You can read our notes for that at the primary [Event Guide](https://github.com/codeandcupcakes/event-guide). However, there is one fundamental piece you will want to research and decide on before you move forward with any other planning: the video call platform to use for the workshop itself.

### Video Platforms

When it comes to video call software, there are a lot of options out there. Which one you choose will depend mostly on your budget and class size. Test out some of these options and decide which will work best for your workshop:

- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)
  - Pros: Free, reliable; Cons: Attendees need to download software to their own computers
- [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/)
  - Pros: Free, open-source; Cons: Relatively new and unknown
- [Whereby](https://whereby.com/)
  - Pros: Free basic plan, simple service; Cons: Costs for more participants
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)
  - Pros: Widely-known, browser-based, free for basic calls; Cons: Reported security issues
- [Google Hangouts Meet](https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/)
  - Pros: Browser-based; Cons: Requires Google accounts

If you plan on offering regular virtual workshops, you might also want to experiment with platforms that are designed for live-streaming, like [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) or [YouTube Live](https://www.youtube.com/live).

Ultimately, you want a video call platform that will let the instructor present your slides, share their screen to demonstrate code and face the attendees. You also want to be able for the instructor and attendees see and hear everyone else, so questions can be asked and answered. Having a chat window is also useful. 

Before the workshop, give attendees detailed information about the video platform you'll be using, including how to sign up and how to install software or join a call. Ask them to check their video and audio and make yourself available to answer questions or help with setup via email.

## Event Details

Delivering presentations and classes virtual is a very different experience than doing so in person, so ask your instructor and attendees be kind and proactive. Instructors should pause often for questions. Consider appointing one volunteer or more to devote themselves the technical aspects of the call and to monitor the chat so that the instructor can focus on teaching. Volunteers can also set up separate calls in case attendees need some one-on-one guidance from the instructor or a teaching assistant.

Unfortunately, virtual event prevent you from offering one of the best part of our workshops: cupcakes. You can, however, encourage attendees to bring their own snacks and take a break during the workshop for everyone to have a treat and chat with each other.

## After the Workshop

Since you won't have the opportunity to wrap things up and hand out resources in person, follow up virtual workshops with an email to all attendees that summarizes the material and provides links to further resources. We have a list of links you can share in our [Workshop Materials](https://github.com/codeandcupcakes/workshop-materials). You can also provide your email addresses and the email addresses of willing volunteers so that you can continue to answer questions and help learners.
